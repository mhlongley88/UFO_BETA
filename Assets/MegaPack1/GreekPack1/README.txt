I would recommend downloading the Official Unity PostProcessing stack (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912) and turning on Ambient Occlusion to improve the look of Low Poly models.

All pieces are <1000 polygons, and come in 2 visually identical versions: standard (separate material) and optimized (single shared texture) version to allow both customization and optimization, depending on your needs.
